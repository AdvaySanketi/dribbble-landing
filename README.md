# Dribbble Landing Page (Concept)

A sleek, modern, and conversion-optimized landing page concept for [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). This is a fictional redesign where I imagined what Dribbble’s homepage could look like if it had a more focused landing experience to attract clients looking to hire top creative talent.

## 🚀 Inspiration

Dribbble is home to millions of designers, but it lacks a dedicated marketing-style landing page that speaks directly to companies looking to hire talent. This project is my creative take on what that might look like.
